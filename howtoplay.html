    <h3>The game</h3>
    <p>The goal of the game is to reach the 25th floor of an enemy-filled dungeon (the "Other World") with your hallmates, 
        and defeat the evil Keynesian tyrant <span style="color:red">Dylan</span>, who is plotting to destroy the world economy as a joke to spite Peter.</p>

    <h3>The hall</h3>
    <p>When you go to the hall, your party heals to full health.</p>
    <p>You can select your party members here, and view their status.</p>

    <h3>The "Other World"</h3>
    <p>You have to search around the dungeon to find stairs to the next floor.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, in the realm of the feared G-mons, G-men, and Gnomes, there are several powerful creatures
        who will try to stop you from reaching their overlord.
    </p>
    <p>For example, on the 4th floor, a <em>Tax Collector</em> is waiting for you.</p>
    
    <h3>Battle</h3>
    <p>In battle, your main objective is not to die. If Peter dies, it's game over for you.</p>
    <p>Peter is weak to melee attacks, which are <em>very common</em> in this game, so you have to be careful.</p>
    <p>Use the buttons below a character (1-2-3-4) to select a target, and the button labelled "E/P" to toggle
        between selecting players and enemies.
    </p>
    <p>If you don't understand what a skill does, just hover over it for a better description!</p>
    <p>Pro tip: Try and find your enemies' weaknesses. By reading the battle log, you can tell if the enemy is weak to your attacks.</p>
    <p>Hitting a weakness does an extra <span style="color: coral">50</span>% damage, which can make battles much easier!
        The more damage you do, the more advantageous it becomes to use weaknesses.</p>

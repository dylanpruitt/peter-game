# peter-game

This game is a dungeon crawler, where the goal of the game is to reach the 20th floor of an enemy-filled dungeon (the "Other World") with your hallmates, and defeat the evil Keynesian tyrant Dylan, who is plotting to destroy the world economy as a joke to spite Peter.

Go to the hall, and recruit your hallmates to stop Dylan.
